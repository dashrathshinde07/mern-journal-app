# Mood Journal App

A simple **Mood Journal App** built with **React** for the frontend and **Node.js** with **MongoDB** for the backend. Users can register, log in, and manage their mood entries through a clean and responsive interface.

## Features Implemented

- **User Authentication**: User registration and login using JWT-based authentication.
- **Journal CRUD Operations**:
  - Create and view journal entries.
  - Update existing journal entries.
- **Tailwind CSS Styling**: The UI is styled using Tailwind CSS for a responsive and modern design.

## Pending Features

1. **Delete Journal Entry**: The delete functionality is not working yet.
2. **Logout Functionality**: No logout button or logic implemented for logging out users.
3. **Display User Details**: The user details (such as email) are not displayed on the UI after login.

## Reason for Incompletion

These features are pending due to time constraints and require additional time for full implementation and testing.
